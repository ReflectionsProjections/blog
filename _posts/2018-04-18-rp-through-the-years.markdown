A timeline of the largest student-run tech conference in the Midwest!  

## [1995](https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/conference/1995/){:target="_blank"}

**What’s new:** The birth of Reflections &#124; Projections!   
**Keynote Speaker(s):** Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer Inc.   
**Highlights:** Theme of the conference was “Reflections &#124; Projections”, had our first ever employment expo & programming contest!  

The 1995 Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference was definitely one for the books! From what we know, the event pretty much had it all. From an employment expo, all the way to a dinner banquet, the 1995 ACM R&#124;P conference was an all-encompassing event. And to top it off, we had Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., as the Keynote Speaker! The idea behind Reflections &#124; Projections was to bring in impactful people in the industry to share their ideas and passions with us on what it means to be a part of the ever-changing, revolutionary, CS industry.

**What’s new:** AI programming competition: Mech-Mania 2!  
**Keynote Speaker(s):** Tim Krauskopf (Founder of Spyglass Inc.); Erich Ringewald (maker of the BeBox.); Alex Osadzinski (VP of Marketing at Be Inc.)  

With the same annual theme as last year — “Reflections &#124; Projections”, the 2nd ACM conference held a campus-wide employment fair and an AI programming competition, Mech-Mania 2! MechMania invited passionate students from across the midwest to code armies of mechanized warriors to take over the galaxy! Along with all this, since conferences aren’t just all work and no play, social events were scheduled all throughout the weekend.

**Highlights:** Mech-Mania 3, Special IEEE guest speaker, Conference party!  

The third annual ACM chapter conference came back strong, with more color, more vigour, and a plethora of things to do for anyone interested in computers or technology! Once again, with sponsors such as Abbott Labs, ComEd, Silicon Graphics, Boeing, IBM, John Deere, and so on, ACM R&#124;P shows how the field of science and technology reaches far beyond the scope of a single computer. Technology is about impact, and through speakers such as Joe Gross from CCSO Unix Systems, and Jay Kreibich from Paradigm Entertainment, the conference did just that — it showed how diverse the field of computer science can possibly be!

The 1998 ACM chapter conference was back with a fresh look but an unchanged philosophy of what it means to be a part of cutting edge computer technology! Apart from all the inspiring speakers, the Panel Discussion on Women in Computing was another highlight of the event! From our very own Susan Linnemeyer (Asst. Dean & Director, Women in Engineering) to Kathy Cupect (Software Developer at Geneer), we had inspiring women lead a discussion on what it means to be a woman in the tech industry. They hit vital topics such as why women don’t take up careers in CS & how the media portrays CS. It was a powerful dialogue that empowered the female engineers of the future!

Along with all this, Barbara Simons, the ACM national lecturer, gave a talk on Computerized and Internet voting! The ninth annual conference also had a creative portion, where undergraduates were invited to submit research projects or ideas to present in the form of a poster. The projects were along the lines of open-source development, independent study, & semester group projects.
